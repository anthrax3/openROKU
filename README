NOTES
-----
This is an update from the library loaded in February. 
Dealing with colons (:) in RSS tags has taken a while. My original approach was to attempt to replace them with
underscores (_) except in URLs. BrightScript perfroms these operations slowly. I've determined that reffering to the 
elements indirectly is faster. This method is demostrated in the TED talks example.
